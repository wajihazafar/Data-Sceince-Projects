## Document Finder
Document Finder provides a fast and easy way to query from directory of documents stored in HDFS. Document Finder finds the relevant document from a list of documents in a directory depending on the query. Querying multiple documents and getting relevant results involves two steps, where in the first step the inverted index with TF-IDF scores for all the documents are calculated and are saved in the HDFS and in second step relevant results are retrieved with maximum TF-IDF scores based on the query. The Document Finder is very fast in returning the relevant documents since it precalculates the TF-IDF scores and uses spark. The best part of the Document Finder is that it first creates the TF-IDF table and saves it in a parquet format. And in the second step it retrieves the relevant document using that table. 
This reduces the unnecessary computation for calculating the TF-IDF scores again and again while fetching the document.
